Running from pattern_exporter
image_tiler returns a tile_list (nested list)
Pass tile_list to coverter 
    Enumerating page number working
    Remove output file name parameter from pattern_exporter. Use format in filename
    
    ---->>>> Next <<<<----
    Use nested list to assign A1, B2, alignment guides - too complicated. use idea below
    Draw function for alignment guide - us graphic overlay instead of draws

    ---->>>> Idea <<<<----
    Replace PIL, draw overlays then crop. Then add borders and page numbers. REduce complexity, looping, and listing
    Keep merge as standalone for common usage
